# Axolotl-Website
This website aims to bring awareness to the endangered axolotl

This is an HTML based website, the navigation bar at the top of the page should lead to the other sections. There are 5 sections in total:
the Home page, the Donate page, the Aquarium page, the Trivia page, and lastly the Contact page.

To set up the server you must run the http-server command in the terminal to set it up for viewing in browser. To reset the page any page to its default state, simply reload the page. If issues persist you should kill the terminal and enter the http-server command again. You should start at the index.html file as that is the home page.

The index.html file is only for reading and does not require any input. You can navigate to the other pages through the navigation bar. The donate.html file contains background information as well as a button that links to an external webpage. The aquarium.html file is also only for viewing and does not require any user input. The trivia.html page has a series of questions separated into sections with series of buttons. Clicking an incorrect answer will turn the button red and display the incorrect text. Clicking the correct answer will turn the button green and display the correct text. Clicking a button twice will not change anything, the only way to reset the buttons is to reload the page. The contact.html file contains an email link that can be pressed.
